## Stumpy

STUMPY is a powerful and scalable Python library (built by Ameritrade) that efficiently computes something called the matrix profile, which is just an academic way of saying “for every (green) subsequence within your time series, automatically identify its corresponding nearest-neighbor (grey)”:

Once you’ve computed your matrix profile (middle panel above) it can then be used for a variety of time series data mining tasks such as:

### What is it used for

* pattern/motif (approximately repeated subsequences within a longer time series) discovery
* anomaly/novelty (discord) discovery
* shapelet discovery
* semantic segmentation
* streaming (on-line) data
* fast approximate matrix profiles
* time series chains (temporally ordered set of subsequence patterns)
* snippets for summarizing long time series
* pan matrix profiles for selecting the best subsequence window size(s)

and more …
